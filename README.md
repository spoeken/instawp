instawp
=======

Install wordpress with a single command, both local and on your development environment, with git offcourse. 
Bootstrap will be downloaded to the themes folder aswell.

How to use it
=============
Remember to have MAMP or whatever you use turned on!

1. Open the script in a text editor and change the creds. 
2. Save the script in your bash scripts folder. Remember to chmod it so its executable. (chmod +x instawp)
3. Open a shell, cd to your localhost directory and type "instawp myprojectname"
4. Spend some time with your coffee cup while the script does your job!

You only have to do step 1 and 2 once :)
